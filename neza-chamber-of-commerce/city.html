				<img src="/wdd230/neza-chamber-of-commerce/images/city-neza-from-sky.jpg" alt="">
				<p>The city of Nezahualcóyotl is nearly coextensive with the municipality of Nezahualcóyotl
				with 99.46% of the municipality's population of 1,110,565 (as of 2010) living within the city
				limits. Only six localities are considered to be outside the city proper: Colonia Gustavo Baz
				Prada, Ciudad Jardín, Relleno Sanitario Nezahualcóyotl Segundo, Polígonos, Escuela Laura Riojas
				de Colosio and 17 de Junio, but the city functions as the local government for these communities.
				It is the second-most populous municipality in the State of Mexico, just below Ecatepec, and
				the ninth-largest in the country. It lies at 2,220 meters above sea level.</p>

				<img src="/wdd230/neza-chamber-of-commerce/images/city-hall.jpg" alt="">
				<p>The municipality is located in the east of the Valley of Mexico and is part of Greater Mexico 
				City. The municipality borders the municipalities of Ecatepec de Morelos, La Paz, Chimalhuacán and
				San Salvador Atenco in the State of Mexico. To the west and south, it borders the borough of 
				Gustavo A. Madero, Venustiano Carranza, Iztapalapa, and Iztacalco of Mexico City, and at the
				northwest, it borders the remains of the Federal Zone of Lake Texcoco. Because of its urban nature, 
				there is no agriculture in the area and livestock production is minimal, restricted to the very 
				northeastern edges of the municipality and only for self-consumption. The economy of the municipality 
				is mostly based on commerce, employing over 90% of the population. The second major employment source
				is industry, mostly microindustries. <em>(Source: Wikipedia. Check out our <a href="/wdd230/neza-chamber-of-commerce/attributions.html">attributions page</a>)</em></p>

			<h2>More about Nezahualcóyotl city.</h2>
			<p><em>Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl is the prototypical informal settlement of metropolitan Mexico City. Built just over
			the line from the Distrito Federal in the Estado de México, Neza—as it is commonly called—looms large in the
			imagination of the city. From its beginnings as an illegally developed, planned, and built settlement in the late
			forties, Neza has served as a powerful image of self-built, so-called “informal” urbanism.
